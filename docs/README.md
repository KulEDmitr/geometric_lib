# Python geometric library
The geometric library is a comprehensive collection of functions that perform calculations for various geometric shapes. The library includes functions for calculating the areas and perimeters of triangles, circles, rectangles, and squares. 

- For triangles, the library provides functions to compute the area using the multiplication of base and height divided by two. The perimeter can be calculated by summing the lengths of the sides.
- Circles are supported with functions to calculate the area using the radius multiplied by self and then to Pi and the perimeter (circumference) using 2 times pi times the radius.
- Rectangles are handled by functions that compute the area by multiplying the side lengths and the perimeter by multiplication of added side lengths and two.
- Squares can have their area calculated using one side length multiplied by self and perimeter using one side length multiplied by four.

## Math formulas
### Area
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²
- Traingle: S = ah / 2

### Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
- Square: P = 4a
- Triangle: P = a + b + c
