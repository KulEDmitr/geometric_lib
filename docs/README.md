# Geometric library
## General description
**This library presents basic functions to find such geometric parameters as area and perimeter. Each shape has its own file.py with _area and perimeter functions_**
## Functions
```python
def area(params) {
    params: shape's params
    return value: area of a shape
}
```
```python
def perimeter(params) {
    params: shape's params
    return value: perimeter of a shape
}
```
