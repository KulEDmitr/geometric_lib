# About geometric_lib
Using geometric formulas for a circle, rectangle, square and triangle, the area and perimeter are calculated.

# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: S = πR²
> r = 3
> 
> area = 28.274333882308138
- Rectangle: S = ab
> a = 3; b = 4
>
> area = 12
- Square: S = a²
> a = 3
>
> area = 9
- Triangle: S = ah / 2
> a = 3; h = 6
>
> area = 9

## Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
> r = 3
>
> perimeter = 18.84955592153876
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
> a = 3; b = 5
>
> perimeter = 16
- Square: P = 4a
> a = 5
>
> perimeter = 20
- Triange: P = a + b + c
> a = 5; b = 6; c = 10
>
> perimeter = 21
